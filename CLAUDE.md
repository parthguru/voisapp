## Pipeline Restrictions

### CI/CD Script Modifications

- Do not modify GitHub Actions or Fastlane scripts unless explicitly requested
- If a modification to these scripts is detected as necessary:
  1. Consult with the team before making any changes
  2. Document the proposed changes and their rationale
  3. Wait for team approval before proceeding

This includes:
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Fastlane scripts
- Build configurations
- Deployment scripts
- Test automation scripts
